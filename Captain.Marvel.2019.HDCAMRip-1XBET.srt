Created by Ysty01 (zsoszo Sync)

2
00:02:03,546 --> 00:02:07,150
Thanks to the Kree CAPITAL OF CIVILIZATION

3
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,819
Do you know what time it is?

4
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:15,019
I can not sleep.

5
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,168
There are drugs on it.

6
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:50,808
If you are taking something now sleeping.

7
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,059
It was another dream?

8
00:02:56,914 --> 00:02:58,264
Fight us?

9
00:03:02,222 --> 00:03:03,372
- I slipped.

10
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:06,375
- Yes. Even because I pulled you one.

11
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:10,078
I had already been pulled before it had slipped. The two are not related.

12
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:12,100
Tell me more about the álmodról ...

13
00:03:14,588 --> 00:03:15,938
- The something new? - No.

14
00:03:21,171 --> 00:03:23,820
- Do not worry about the past. - I do not remember my past

15
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,212
- A lot of doubt in you. Doubt makes vulnerable.

16
00:03:34,907 --> 00:03:37,354
- Dominate your strength.

17
00:03:37,554 --> 00:03:41,542
If you lose your head again, again calling himself the supreme intelligence,

18
00:03:41,742 --> 00:03:43,833
It is not dangerous for a fighter

19
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:45,585
As emotions.

20
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:50,415
You do not concentrate while joking.

21
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:55,367
And anger, anger can only benefit the enemy.

22
00:04:06,926 --> 00:04:09,890
120 days have passed since the last Skrull attack.

23
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,137
- Have you ever seen someone that looks like a supreme intelligence? - No.

24
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,988
You can not look at no one true form.

25
00:04:18,188 --> 00:04:25,098
You know that. The subconscious, there appears to you. It is sacred.

26
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,850
Personal. We do not talk about it to anyone.

27
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,799
How is it for you?

28
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:31,999
- The tesódként? - No.

29
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,199
- As a father? - No.

30
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,758
- Former parancsnokodként. - Are you kidding?

31
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:37,407
You see my form, right?

32
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:40,836
- I know what mesterkedsz. - I do it well?

33
00:04:41,036 --> 00:04:42,036
-Again.

34
00:04:42,077 --> 00:04:43,685
But you will not distract the subject.

35
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:47,883
-What you give sense to do that if you do not let me use.

36
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:54,436
You have to use. The intelligence chief said he teach you how to treat it.

37
00:04:54,636 --> 00:04:57,798
- I can handle it. - If you could give would be to knock off without it.

38
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:04,147
Controlled your instincts. Do not use this, but this here.

39
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:09,500
I want to be the best, bring it out of you.

40
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:14,771
SUPREME INTELLIGENCE HEAD OF CIVILIZATION Kreek

41
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:52,874
- Poem. - Called for you.

42
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,784
The commander stated that you are ready for deployment.

43
00:05:56,984 --> 00:05:58,736
That's right.

44
00:05:58,936 --> 00:06:01,892
Viaskodsz of emotions.

45
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:04,848
The past lashed them.

46
00:06:06,377 --> 00:06:11,680
You can you fall victim to our civilization, threatening several centuries, Skrull expansion.

47
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,981
Fraudulently insinuate us and take over the planets.

48
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:24,746
Trace the desktop and many other horrors that you can not recall.

49
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,751
All lost. The whole thing of the past.

50
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:35,111
You're supposed to answer the shape of the person you look up to most.

51
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,285
BUT I do not even remember.

52
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:39,313
Who was this man in my life.

53
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:43,813
Perhaps you kind of fate. Spare me the greater suffering.

54
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:47,815
Emancipate, it tehesd you need to Keeként.

55
00:06:48,015 --> 00:06:50,168
The people megboldogulása be the first.

56
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:56,129
Great gift you received from us, you will be able to fight for the good of Kreek.

57
00:06:57,688 --> 00:07:00,238
- I am pleased to fights. - You can conquer yourself.

58
00:07:00,438 --> 00:07:03,297
Otherwise, what you get back is taken.

59
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:10,949
- I did not disappoint. - you'll prove you.

60
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:17,065
Your mission is. Serve with integrity and honor.

61
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:41,019
- Evil cells. - Obviously, the Skrull again.

62
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:43,169
One thing is certain. Big trouble.

63
00:07:44,023 --> 00:07:47,926
- Skrull has slipped your skin? - Of course, it was very upsetting.

64
00:07:48,126 --> 00:07:50,928
- Why? - I stood face to face with the deadly enemy subject.

65
00:07:51,128 --> 00:07:56,332
- And I looked at myself in the eye. - But you'd be handsome if he would be less upsetting, is not it?

66
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:59,202
- You think you're funny. Not laugh. - Well, you never do.

67
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:00,203
I used to.

68
00:08:00,403 --> 00:08:02,531
Just inside.

69
00:08:03,794 --> 00:08:06,862
- But it did not come. - Speaking Őszitén is appealing visage.

70
00:08:07,062 --> 00:08:09,611
- Thank you. All right people enough.

71
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:14,013
Attention. Here's the deal.

72
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:21,068
We have to save the kémünket, Solart. A Skrull again invaded our planet is a limit.

73
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:26,227
This time, the Torf. Solar sent a warning message that you captured.

74
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:27,746
So there in disguise.

75
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:33,048
A Skrull Talos General sent him several units to liquidate.

76
00:08:33,248 --> 00:08:38,215
If you go to find the info collected over three years, they will be in their hands.

77
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:46,045
The accusers are Skrul a fortress under fire in the south. What we find within it, Solart.

78
00:08:46,245 --> 00:08:48,823
We'll pick you up at the Skrull only blink.

79
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:53,424
And it is very important not to get into conflict with the Torfaiakkal.

80
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:57,180
Nothing could endanger the safety of the mission.

81
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,630
Be on your guard. In order to keep down the process.

82
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:07,498
The action is risky. You may have to join the collective.

83
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:12,499
If this is our fate. The good of Kree. - The good of Kree.

84
00:09:27,723 --> 00:09:30,059
Torf Kreek LIMIT THE PLANET

85
00:10:21,207 --> 00:10:24,407
Measure Solar poem into position.

86
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:28,268
Att-Lass, Minn-Ervan, seek high ground.

87
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:49,306
Locals nearby. Approx. A dozen.

88
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:56,593
- Minn-Ervan. - Can you hear. Can anyone hear me?

89
00:10:56,793 --> 00:10:58,742
- I repeat.

90
00:11:10,742 --> 00:11:12,208
It comes from the church sign.

91
00:11:12,595 --> 00:11:13,396
- Let's go. - No.

92
00:11:14,197 --> 00:11:17,558
Here you can easily bring backlash on us. Only one way that leads there.

93
00:11:17,758 --> 00:11:18,869
Odatudunk easy.

94
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:20,730
We do not know who's there.

95
00:11:21,131 --> 00:11:23,206
- Too risky. - If you do not come I'll go alone.

96
00:11:23,406 --> 00:11:25,681
No. Forget it.

97
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:31,191
Well. Do not spread out.

98
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:34,341
If we lose each other, we meet at the machine.

99
00:11:34,743 --> 00:11:35,793
Come on!

100
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:51,150
- Att-Lass hear me? - Yes. I see them.

101
00:11:58,443 --> 00:11:59,710
Back.

102
00:12:01,072 --> 00:12:01,868
Back.

103
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,524
Commander.

104
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:15,831
Minn-Ervan see what we have here?

105
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,629
- Keep away from them. - Minn-Ervan!

106
00:12:20,293 --> 00:12:21,496
Can anyone hear me?

107
00:12:26,135 --> 00:12:28,359
It does not hurt my brain.

108
00:12:34,743 --> 00:12:35,765
Stay there.

109
00:12:38,683 --> 00:12:39,983
These locals.

110
00:12:40,251 --> 00:12:43,785
- Two dead, but there are no greens. - They're just hungry.

111
00:13:09,185 --> 00:13:14,238
- HVX78.
- TRT79-BVX6.

112
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:17,920
Bron Char-do. Back.

113
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:28,856
Skrullok.

114
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:12,965
Bombers.

115
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:21,017
The Helionra ... Can you hear me? The Helionra.

116
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:27,677
- How did you know the code? - I'll tell you my secret.

117
00:14:29,623 --> 00:14:31,627
After telling me yours.

118
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:39,001
Let's look into it.

119
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:52,846
- Where are we now? - Screenshots.

120
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,618
Far did you go? Among the clouds.

121
00:14:57,818 --> 00:15:00,331
- Well you? - two feet on the ground.

122
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:03,834
We'll show him how to do it. Are you ready?

123
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:05,034
- Up on the stars. - Yep.

124
00:15:15,588 --> 00:15:17,793
That can not be.

125
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:21,291
Let's go back even deeper.

126
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,559
You go too fast, slow is good.

127
00:15:40,877 --> 00:15:43,881
- Who's that? - It certainly is not ...

128
00:15:43,937 --> 00:15:46,886
- No place for you. - Excessively we went back ...

129
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:50,005
- O is lead. - I'll try anything.

130
00:15:54,165 --> 00:16:01,722
- No place for you. - Leave him out. still wants to play.

131
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,943
- Never let the machine. - Maybe I just do not understand what's going on here?

132
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:13,703
Quite a good pilot.

133
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:16,958
But it's too hot-headed. not with a joystick in the hands of babes.

134
00:16:17,158 --> 00:16:18,518
Do you understand?

135
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,897
He began to shake the cosmos. He was shaking the moon.

136
00:16:29,097 --> 00:16:34,788
The sun and the stars in the sky. And then the little alue vanished into the night.

137
00:16:35,097 --> 00:16:37,610
You see? He was alue.

138
00:16:39,356 --> 00:16:41,157
Here now been completed. the food is ready.

139
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:42,358
Get ready for boarding.

140
00:16:43,193 --> 00:16:47,196
- But good memories. - May. I think it is.

141
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:56,307
- Goose is for you. I do not like people. - started early in the day?

142
00:16:56,507 --> 00:17:00,643
Ah, the night dragged on. I can not sleep when a lot of work. Familiar?

143
00:17:00,843 --> 00:17:02,479
The flight never felt work.

144
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,946
Sing...

145
00:17:04,146 --> 00:17:07,116
- It's a beautiful country, is not it? - I like to look down from above better.

146
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:09,285
Soon feljutsz far.

147
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:11,086
Wait, wait, wait. He is. Bring it back.

148
00:17:11,286 --> 00:17:13,223
Now.

149
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,106
Familiar.

150
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:23,065
- It's a beautiful country, is not it? - I like to look down from above better.

151
00:17:23,498 --> 00:17:26,871
- you'll go so far feljutsz. - What is written on the jacket. Does not seem to...

152
00:17:27,071 --> 00:17:35,076
- It's a beautiful country, is not it? - I like to look down from above better.

153
00:17:35,276 --> 00:17:36,879
- you'll go so far feljutsz. - Concentrate.

154
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:40,683
- What? - Look down. Concentrate.

155
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:44,420
Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson. He is.

156
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,323
- You heard that? - We know where it is?

157
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,929
Measure it. Follow Lawson as long as you do not measure the power signal.

158
00:17:57,231 --> 00:17:59,534
Interesting.

159
00:18:01,037 --> 00:18:06,575
Ah. Wait. Go back to direct it. Even further back.

160
00:18:07,577 --> 00:18:09,145
- They are not villózók.

161
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:13,950
Let's see where you're flying. This is it. Look at the coordinates.

162
00:18:15,785 --> 00:18:17,521
Koncentrálj.

163
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:24,894
Open your eyes. It is clever, you will immediately succeed. Do not resist.

164
00:18:25,962 --> 00:18:27,764
Koncentrálj.

165
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:31,600
Bring it back. Bring it back. Come on.

166
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:38,173
Come. What happened after that? Where did he go.

167
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:55,592
Is there any other information which is worth something?

168
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:59,261
It's just that Lawson was somewhere around the C-53rd

169
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:00,461
We are on the way there.

170
00:19:00,229 --> 00:19:02,197
We can dig deeper.

171
00:19:02,397 --> 00:19:05,368
Lawson brings us to the light-speed gearbox.

172
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:09,105
And everything we're looking for.

173
00:19:16,544 --> 00:19:21,349
Oh, responded to this. Do it again.

174
00:19:32,827 --> 00:19:33,829
Not yet.

175
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:47,343
- What did you do to me? - Only some information is needed.

176
00:19:47,543 --> 00:19:51,747
- What do you planted it in my head? - Nothing, that was not it.

177
00:19:51,947 --> 00:19:56,419
- These are not my memories. - It's as if hallucinating, right?

178
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:58,753
- No wonder you're confused.

179
00:19:58,953 --> 00:20:03,059
- Thoroughly stirred his head. - Enough to hear játszadozásból.

180
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:07,030
- What do you want? - The care, where is Dr. Lawson.

181
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,868
- And the light-speed gearbox. - I do not know any Lawson.

182
00:20:12,068 --> 00:20:15,971
Really, then why is it so much memory?

183
00:20:46,136 --> 00:20:49,005
You do not know that they can be picked guys?

184
00:20:50,006 --> 00:20:51,240
No? Okay.

185
00:22:23,366 --> 00:22:24,933
Shell.

186
00:22:48,925 --> 00:22:52,895
Are you leaving? Just to raise a total break us.

187
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:44,411
C-53 planett Terrain OTTHONA

188
00:24:15,744 --> 00:24:18,948
Verse call centers. Can you hear?

189
00:24:20,381 --> 00:24:24,119
Hey. Did you?

190
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:58,020
Hello. I csillagosztagos poem. This C-53?

191
00:24:58,954 --> 00:25:03,926
- Do you understand what I'm saying? It works with my interpretation? - Yes. I understand you.

192
00:25:04,126 --> 00:25:07,263
Oh, cool. You are responsible for security in this area?

193
00:25:07,463 --> 00:25:12,169
We are going for it. But the cinema is his own man.

194
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:16,338
Where can I find the means of communication?

195
00:25:22,644 --> 00:25:23,645
Dirt.

196
00:25:56,178 --> 00:25:58,312
Locate the cabin and the girl.

197
00:25:59,515 --> 00:26:01,883
We know more than you know.

198
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,790
Hey, it's been busy.

199
00:26:19,535 --> 00:26:20,501
Come on!

200
00:26:20,701 --> 00:26:29,246
- Poem. Poem. CTC39 control. - GRXT1600. I'm fine anyway. Thanks a lot.

201
00:26:29,246 --> 00:26:34,117
- you did not trouble again? What happened? - lured into a trap. I thought you were dead.

202
00:26:34,317 --> 00:26:36,284
- You found Solart? - Solar was not.

203
00:26:36,484 --> 00:26:40,923
- Talos pulled on his skin. he knew the code. - But that's impossible.

204
00:26:41,123 --> 00:26:45,561
- Solar was embedded in his subconscious. - A Skrull kutakodtak in my mind.

205
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:48,209
And I think the same machine Solar also picked out the head of the code.

206
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:51,132
- Poetry, where are you now? - The planet's C53.

207
00:26:51,966 --> 00:26:55,469
- The Skrull are looking for a specific Lawson. - Who?

208
00:26:55,669 --> 00:27:00,574
- He's the one you see. - What?

209
00:27:03,544 --> 00:27:07,714
- Poem. Poem. What? - be a scientist.

210
00:27:07,914 --> 00:27:11,385
He invented a light-speed stuff. I need to find before the Skrull.

211
00:27:11,585 --> 00:27:13,387
Otherwise, they rush off new galaxies.

212
00:27:13,387 --> 00:27:18,059
No. Wait. Once they have been caught anyway. How far is the C-53?

213
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:20,728
There is a jump point. 22 hours away.

214
00:27:20,928 --> 00:27:24,432
Poem. Stay there until we get there. The signal may arise must be switched on to let you.

215
00:27:24,632 --> 00:27:27,100
No. What if you earned before ...

216
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:33,275
We are sorry. The distance of your tárcsázottszámhoz ID belongs. - Poem.

217
00:27:33,475 --> 00:27:36,778
Towards. Towards.

218
00:27:38,046 --> 00:27:42,516
- When worked the Skrull be dangerous. - tougher than you think.

219
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:50,290
- Have you ever been on a C-53? - Once. Leprosy is quite a place.

220
00:28:11,012 --> 00:28:13,214
You're meant?

221
00:28:26,995 --> 00:28:28,596
Transmitter is activated.

222
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:38,372
Excuse me madam. He had not seen it happen to a woman who broke through the top of the video store?

223
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:41,743
According to witnesses Concerning the laser was a warrior costume.

224
00:28:41,943 --> 00:28:46,280
Oh, I think it went.

225
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:53,912
As a condition you a few questions. Then I'll tell you how to take back the night kazikat.

226
00:28:54,112 --> 00:28:58,325
- I could request credentials? - Poetry'm csillagosztagos.

227
00:28:58,525 --> 00:29:05,533
- The identification, we do not use cards. - Poetry, csillagosztagos.

228
00:29:05,733 --> 00:29:08,703
- How long will the city? - Just as long rioters of time,

229
00:29:08,903 --> 00:29:12,239
I find the Skrullokat who have infiltrated themselves do.

230
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:15,175
- The Skrullokat? - The alakváltókat.

231
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:18,546
Whatever they can copy the DNA level down.

232
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:24,351
Oh my God. Themselves have no idea about this. - Na, na, na, wait.

233
00:29:24,619 --> 00:29:30,258
Tell me, how do we know you're not a changeling?

234
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:34,261
Congratulations Fury Agent. We finally managed to ask a meaningful question.

235
00:29:34,461 --> 00:29:39,066
I can not congratulate you, csillagosztagos. You're under arrest.

236
00:29:47,475 --> 00:29:48,710
Running.

237
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,945
New boy come.

238
00:30:00,721 --> 00:30:02,657
- He did not see that he's got a weapon? - I did not see you, sir.

239
00:30:46,266 --> 00:30:49,103
The suspect is north of the subway, we follow.

240
00:31:41,248 --> 00:31:41,622
Oh, it was rough.

241
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:05,071
The subway immediately go into the tunnel.

242
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:08,876
Let's go to the next station.

243
00:33:21,655 --> 00:33:25,526
Mr. Fury. This is Agent Coulson. I'm still in the videotékánál.

244
00:33:25,726 --> 00:33:29,429
Tell me, where was everybody?

245
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,233
I collected the evidence and ...

246
00:35:07,762 --> 00:35:10,297
It was the SHIELD action here. Break it up.

247
00:35:43,597 --> 00:35:44,432
PANCHO'S BAR

248
00:35:59,147 --> 00:36:00,747
Pretty in diving outfit.

249
00:36:05,853 --> 00:36:10,857
Do not look so crossly. I get a smile?

250
00:36:14,428 --> 00:36:15,829
Silly goose.

251
00:36:34,314 --> 00:36:38,352
The carbon-based life form on earth for all. He did not.

252
00:36:38,552 --> 00:36:42,922
What is also a bar, not in the periodic table.

253
00:36:43,122 --> 00:36:46,159
In other words, you must have arrived in a distant world?

254
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:47,961
How are your eyes?

255
00:36:48,161 --> 00:36:54,033
Well, all right. But now they're not really believe him.

256
00:36:54,233 --> 00:37:02,676
- So, here it looked like Coulson? - And he spoke.

257
00:37:02,876 --> 00:37:08,082
- The woman said to have more? - it said that infiltrated us.

258
00:37:08,582 --> 00:37:10,484
- You believe him? - Yes, ever since I saw it.

259
00:37:12,886 --> 00:37:17,191
- What's the plan? - To find the tékás girl.

260
00:37:17,391 --> 00:37:20,460
Motortolvajról heard from a person who fits the description.

261
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,832
They explain what they want in these lizards, and perhaps help them kipaterolni.

262
00:37:26,032 --> 00:37:33,875
Correct. But action alone. We can not trust anyone. Our people do not even own.

263
00:37:34,075 --> 00:37:35,409
Indeed sir.

264
00:37:49,923 --> 00:37:52,926
Wow. An ugly acquired is not it?

265
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:56,863
Yeah. Brad Pitt is not one, sir.

266
00:38:01,335 --> 00:38:08,976
Have a good trip to the other world, my friend. I promise I will finish what we started.

267
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:19,219
I have not leaned so close.

268
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:23,523
Listen to the UFO.

269
00:39:24,651 --> 00:39:28,355
- What does he want. - Where was this photo?

270
00:39:28,555 --> 00:39:30,957
- an airport. - Where is the Pegasus.

271
00:39:31,157 --> 00:39:32,825
The confidential.

272
00:39:33,025 --> 00:39:37,030
Just like the file that you opened yourself.

273
00:39:38,933 --> 00:39:43,002
He, meantime, had changed. I hit it a casual style?

274
00:39:43,202 --> 00:39:48,140
- It was a difficult day Fury Agent? - Sufficient. You know extraterrestrial invasion.

275
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:52,379
Car chase. And I could see a real UFO autopsy well.

276
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:55,869
- an average weekday. - So you saw one.

277
00:39:56,069 --> 00:40:02,122
I never believed in it, that there is something. But no doubt after that.

278
00:40:02,322 --> 00:40:04,891
It will now be a little weird, but I have to ask.

279
00:40:05,091 --> 00:40:07,061
Afraid that I am a green thing?

280
00:40:07,261 --> 00:40:08,262
I can not risk.

281
00:40:08,462 --> 00:40:13,434
What you see now, with a 100% pirosvérű earthling.

282
00:40:13,634 --> 00:40:17,270
- Unfortunately, the evidence can be. - Saliva sample or have urinated in a cup?

283
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:20,207
- No. The DNA be correct. - Should I set a PIN code?

284
00:40:20,407 --> 00:40:23,209
A Skrull can only get to know the most recent memories of the hosts.

285
00:40:23,409 --> 00:40:26,949
Whoa. vájkálni want my past.

286
00:40:27,149 --> 00:40:30,152
- Where were you born? - Pairsvielben, but I confess that I've just told.

287
00:40:30,352 --> 00:40:32,554
- First dog? - Nozzle Cinemas.

288
00:40:32,754 --> 00:40:33,980
- Nozzle -moz? - You heard me. I passed?

289
00:40:35,089 --> 00:40:39,626
- Not yet. First job? - The army right after high school. I installed off as a colonel.

290
00:40:39,861 --> 00:40:40,596
- Then? -Kémkedtem.

291
00:40:40,796 --> 00:40:41,864
- Where? - Everywhere.

292
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:45,434
Raged the Cold War. Belfast. Bucharest, Belgrade, Budapest.

293
00:40:45,634 --> 00:40:48,170
- Full of B-letter city. - Now?

294
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:51,941
6 years ago I'm sitting in an office. And then trying to figure out where the enemy is coming.

295
00:40:52,141 --> 00:40:54,844
So far it never occurred to me that it might come from above.

296
00:40:55,044 --> 00:41:00,082
Tell a bizarre habit, which is a Skrull, would not find out.

297
00:41:00,282 --> 00:41:03,951
If I do not eat the toast cut across it.

298
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,285
- That was not necessary, right? - No. Really not. But it was funny.

299
00:41:10,485 --> 00:41:13,754
All right, you come. So that not Skrull.

300
00:41:22,196 --> 00:41:26,601
And yet this ought to know that you're not a Skrull?

301
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:28,636
- It was a ray photon. - And?

302
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:30,772
A Skrull can not do that.

303
00:41:30,972 --> 00:41:32,833
So was a colonel, and spy agency SHIELD.

304
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:41,541
- Obviously, access to a whole lot of data. Where is the Pegasus? - Uh-oh.

305
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:48,695
So. A Skrull alien species of wine, take over power on those planets.

306
00:41:48,795 --> 00:41:53,582
- You and Kree. As for the race of noble warriors. - heroes.

307
00:41:53,782 --> 00:41:58,513
- The heroes of noble species. - And what do they want a Skrull, Dr. Lawsontól?

308
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:04,702
They believe invented a light-speed gearbox Pegasus.

309
00:42:04,902 --> 00:42:09,373
What did you find it? After all, it's not the craziest thing I heard today.

310
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,110
- Well, it's early. - What do you want?

311
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:16,590
I want to set the Skrullokat, while there is still a way.

312
00:42:16,724 --> 00:42:18,848
And?

313
00:42:20,652 --> 00:42:24,123
Watch the war of the same everywhere.

314
00:42:24,323 --> 00:42:29,993
I know what it's like getting a private military action. You're personally involved in the case.

315
00:42:40,737 --> 00:42:47,178
- This is government land. Consult your vehicle. - Nicholas Joseph Fury. The SHIELD agent.

316
00:42:47,378 --> 00:42:51,281
Put your finger on the reader. A moment.

317
00:42:50,179 --> 00:42:55,722
Nicholas Joseph Fury? Three names are?

318
00:42:55,922 --> 00:43:01,758
Everyone is calling Fury. Nicholas Joseph is not not, not an agent. Just Fury.

319
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:02,893
- That he called his mother? - Fury.

320
00:43:03,093 --> 00:43:04,428
- And you now? - Fury.

321
00:43:04,628 --> 00:43:08,542
- What about the children? - Well, if you are going to be called Fury.

322
00:43:08,776 --> 00:43:10,511
- recovered from the area. - Thank you.

323
00:43:40,899 --> 00:43:45,235
Hey, wait. It looks as if some rebellious teenage girl.

324
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:48,572
Take it up.

325
00:43:48,772 --> 00:43:50,808
- What is that? - The logo of SHIELD.

326
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:58,649
- Sure, it helps the secret work? - Asking the dismount running around szerkóban extraterrestrial.

327
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:02,820
The shirt stays.

328
00:44:13,447 --> 00:44:19,770
- The SHIELD at work. - We are looking for a woman named Lawson.

329
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:22,172
Dr. Wendy Lawson.

330
00:44:23,907 --> 00:44:25,577
He knows him?

331
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:31,191
Follow me.

332
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:38,465
You know what they say, that being wheeled out the red carpet?

333
00:44:39,724 --> 00:44:43,370
- No. - Do not do this.

334
00:44:51,736 --> 00:44:55,663
- The communicator? - Yeah. Tweeter hyper-modern two-way.

335
00:44:55,863 --> 00:45:00,477
- Whose message? - My mother. Chill does not mention himself.

336
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:01,677
They closed down the target. I need reinforcements.

337
00:45:03,192 --> 00:45:04,825
"I swamped the target, should gain"

338
00:45:14,726 --> 00:45:16,059
ARCHIVES

339
00:45:28,606 --> 00:45:29,939
You, hu, hu.

340
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:41,585
- After you. - Not bad.

341
00:45:41,785 --> 00:45:45,865
Oh, what you should see a gépkapoccsal.

342
00:45:57,302 --> 00:46:05,317
Hello kitty. What's up. Oh, God, I at one. It should be to eat a you. How can such a small ...

343
00:46:05,317 --> 00:46:08,855
... scoop of sugar that can be. You say your name was? What's your name?

344
00:46:09,689 --> 00:46:12,759
Goose. Name reaching such a nice kitty, right.

345
00:46:12,759 --> 00:46:14,894
- Fury.
- Igen?

346
00:46:16,688 --> 00:46:18,022
I'll come back.

347
00:46:21,927 --> 00:46:26,198
Oh, to be the new imprint. You just have to fold.

348
00:46:29,642 --> 00:46:32,145
He watched as the mylar screw up.

349
00:46:32,345 --> 00:46:34,314
- While it would have been enough. - I did not want lelombozni.

350
00:46:51,832 --> 00:46:54,600
At. Lawson.

351
00:47:04,578 --> 00:47:06,193
Here's the blueprint for light-speed gearbox.

352
00:47:07,915 --> 00:47:10,016
Why has it stopped the Project?

353
00:47:11,952 --> 00:47:15,355
Maybe it's because Lawson retard.

354
00:47:17,389 --> 00:47:20,727
- Kree signs? - Well.

355
00:47:22,192 --> 00:47:26,866
Lawson did not retard. But Kree.

356
00:47:27,634 --> 00:47:31,171
- Oh, and dead. - We?

357
00:47:31,371 --> 00:47:35,008
The plane crashed during a test flight of unauthorized.

358
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:37,409
And the pilot who was with him.

359
00:47:37,411 --> 00:47:42,182
That is why such unfriendly eternal. Conceal this real big blunder.

360
00:47:44,251 --> 00:47:47,154
And the light-speed gearbox Tropa.

361
00:47:50,823 --> 00:47:52,593
When you went down this machine?

362
00:47:52,793 --> 00:47:55,529
Six years ago. 1989.

363
00:47:57,664 --> 00:48:02,501
- Who was the pilot? - uncovered many details.

364
00:48:02,701 --> 00:48:07,207
But here's a confession of a certain Captain Maria Rambeau.

365
00:48:07,407 --> 00:48:10,411
He last saw them alive.

366
00:48:10,509 --> 00:48:13,046
"We're here. Where are they?" (I guess this just do not see the picture)

367
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:17,216
- Well? - Uh-huh.

368
00:48:20,185 --> 00:48:22,055
I'll be back.

369
00:48:51,617 --> 00:48:55,388
We do not want to fight in wars. It's closed.

370
00:49:01,469 --> 00:49:06,132
I know that Lawson was Kree. C-53 went on and died in plane crash.

371
00:49:06,332 --> 00:49:11,705
- Do you know anything about this? - I recently saw a report.

372
00:49:11,905 --> 00:49:15,207
Which they were sent to about C53. I did not get permission to beavassalak everything.

373
00:49:15,407 --> 00:49:24,184
But Kree ... Lawson was a secret agent. They called MAR-VELL.

374
00:49:24,317 --> 00:49:27,420
Alítani may want a special power core.

375
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:32,725
We are experimenting with a technology which megnyerhetnénk the war.

376
00:49:39,066 --> 00:49:42,301
- Even here there is a woman? - Yes. And work with us.

377
00:49:42,634 --> 00:49:44,560
- You stay here. - Indeed sir.

378
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,806
I want to interrogate alone.

379
00:49:48,207 --> 00:49:50,876
Well done. Nicholas.

380
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:55,848
There is a report anything about me?

381
00:49:56,048 --> 00:50:02,255
- Anything about you? Not, of course? Why would it be? - I found no evidence that I lived here.

382
00:50:02,455 --> 00:50:04,122
A C-53-on?

383
00:50:04,322 --> 00:50:10,829
MAR-VELL-t I see when I go to supreme intelligence. I knew him.

384
00:50:11,031 --> 00:50:12,632
It added Lawsonként.

385
00:50:12,832 --> 00:50:16,237
- It's like a Skrull have slipped your skin, unnoticed. - No, not like that.

386
00:50:16,437 --> 00:50:19,171
- I remember I lived here. - Enough. Do not forget the training.

387
00:50:19,371 --> 00:50:22,775
Know your enemy. You can be in. Do not let your emotions ...

388
00:50:22,975 --> 00:50:25,277
... obscure your judgment.

389
00:50:26,712 --> 00:50:29,348
The sixth floor is a minus. I'm not going down that long.

390
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:32,385
The stairwell waiting when you cut it.

391
00:50:32,585 --> 00:50:38,827
- Good old pincers. As long ago, Havana. - Yes, as long Havana.

392
00:50:49,803 --> 00:50:52,971
Close to the jump point. I find you on the basis of the signals arise.

393
00:50:53,171 --> 00:50:55,874
Following the end of the matter.

394
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:57,074
Together.

395
00:50:59,746 --> 00:51:00,980
All right.

396
00:51:18,965 --> 00:51:20,366
Towards.

397
00:51:22,568 --> 00:51:23,268
Towards.

398
00:51:29,343 --> 00:51:30,943
I look closely, you go left.

399
00:51:40,221 --> 00:51:43,390
- Fury in cahoots with célszemélyjel. - Then why are you calling here?

400
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:45,257
All I know is that you need to get him dead or alive.

401
00:51:45,457 --> 00:51:47,460
Dead or alive?

402
00:52:02,475 --> 00:52:03,443
Then, pressure. Hurry - hurry.

403
00:52:15,922 --> 00:52:18,758
Maybe I say something wrong?

404
00:52:56,629 --> 00:53:00,967
Well, you really do not need glasses to me to see.

405
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:05,639
In turn, from the overall effect will be perfect.

406
00:53:05,971 --> 00:53:07,439
Do not you think?

407
00:53:24,391 --> 00:53:27,225
- you invited them here? - I screwed up.

408
00:53:41,741 --> 00:53:44,593
- Coulson see them? - There are not any.

409
00:53:47,121 --> 00:53:48,046
Let's see above.

410
00:53:56,823 --> 00:53:58,225
- What? - The communicator.

411
00:53:58,425 --> 00:54:00,893
You've no good hands.

412
00:54:30,923 --> 00:54:33,993
- You know how to drive this thing? - We'll see.

413
00:54:34,193 --> 00:54:35,962
It was a yes-no question.

414
00:54:39,766 --> 00:54:40,999
- Again.

415
00:54:44,236 --> 00:54:46,272
So you see this is more like it.

416
00:55:11,096 --> 00:55:14,699
- Groos. - Look buckshee a passenger.

417
00:55:18,365 --> 00:55:19,672
Endurance Groos.

418
00:55:24,944 --> 00:55:25,878
Goose.

419
00:55:25,912 --> 00:55:30,750
Oh ... Do not draw.

420
00:55:31,084 --> 00:55:34,286
Who's a good kitty hear? Well Goose?

421
00:55:34,754 --> 00:55:40,126
Yes. You're clever. Well the good cat Goose. You're the best cat.

422
00:55:40,592 --> 00:55:41,394
Recognize anyone?

423
00:55:42,156 --> 00:55:46,698
Think before you got to the planet Hala. I almost died.

424
00:55:46,898 --> 00:55:50,237
I got amnesia. It happened six years ago.

425
00:55:50,437 --> 00:55:53,808
He thinks you're the pilot who crashed there Lawson?

426
00:55:54,008 --> 00:55:57,242
The last person who saw them might find to say.

427
00:55:57,442 --> 00:55:59,611
- Maria Rambeau.
- Ühüm.

428
00:55:59,811 --> 00:56:01,147
Lousianaba to get there?

429
00:56:01,347 --> 00:56:04,784
Eastern direction. Then Memphisnél right.

430
00:56:06,285 --> 00:56:12,158
- The agent, who let get away. - Coulson, the new guy.

431
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:15,928
- I think he still does not hate. - you do not know quite long.

432
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:20,466
I think it was a hunch. instincts.

433
00:56:20,666 --> 00:56:25,370
Do not click. This is a very difficult thing. But since we're humans.

434
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:29,708
- I've had trouble ilyesmiből. Often. - Oh, yes, I can believe.

435
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:33,980
He saved the guy who threw the Skrulloknak.

436
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:37,351
Something tells me that this is not exactly Kreeknél common practice.

437
00:56:37,551 --> 00:56:39,793
When not wearing your boss if you do not own me.

438
00:56:47,627 --> 00:56:50,830
- Ronan. - The accusers performed the task.

439
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:53,256
But the important mission failed. Because of you.

440
00:56:53,456 --> 00:56:57,702
- Say you had success? - So our agents lured the verse in Torfaen.

441
00:56:57,902 --> 00:56:59,572
- To kidnap. - Add your situation.

442
00:56:59,772 --> 00:57:03,476
- take care of the terrorists. - So that szétbombázzátok them?

443
00:57:03,676 --> 00:57:06,512
No. We'll solve it.

444
00:57:06,712 --> 00:57:11,651
A Skrull team anywhere in the world, a threat everywhere. Where are they?

445
00:57:11,851 --> 00:57:14,252
Currently, we do not know.

446
00:57:14,452 --> 00:57:17,056
We do not know. For now.

447
00:57:17,256 --> 00:57:19,992
- But we find them. - So be it.

448
00:57:21,361 --> 00:57:23,395
Or we will.

449
00:57:26,898 --> 00:57:28,734
Keep the direction toward the C-53rd

450
00:57:47,554 --> 00:57:50,856
Excuse me, I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

451
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,429
Aunt Carol? Maternal. Aunt Carol.

452
00:57:57,464 --> 00:57:59,765
I knew it. Everyone said you were dead.

453
00:57:59,965 --> 00:58:01,467
But we knew they were lying.

454
00:58:03,969 --> 00:58:06,304
I'm not exactly who you mean.

455
00:58:15,046 --> 00:58:17,749
- I've never heard such a crazy story.

456
00:58:17,782 --> 00:58:19,284
Green shapeshifting aliens?

457
00:58:19,651 --> 00:58:22,922
- They can not. - You're right, you're right, absolutely.

458
00:58:23,022 --> 00:58:27,993
They're not well. Because, if they were not sure it kürtölnénk world.

459
00:58:28,193 --> 00:58:29,729
You do not believe me?

460
00:58:37,335 --> 00:58:40,338
Oh no. It's damn cool.

461
00:58:40,538 --> 00:58:43,543
- The water forralásnál much more capable of hands. - For example?

462
00:58:43,743 --> 00:58:46,412
- Show more. - Maybe later.

463
00:58:46,612 --> 00:58:49,882
Oh, you've got your stuff. I bring here.

464
00:58:50,783 --> 00:58:52,451
You do not want to help him?

465
00:59:08,834 --> 00:59:16,241
- you do not remember anything? - Sometimes felrémlik something.

466
00:59:16,441 --> 00:59:21,413
Tiny moments. But you can not even memories.

467
00:59:23,349 --> 00:59:26,117
If összetudnánk together what happened that morning.

468
00:59:26,786 --> 00:59:29,056
Perhaps, they win all understanding.

469
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:37,029
You woke me up. You burst into me at dawn. Habitually.

470
00:59:37,863 --> 00:59:40,199
At that time we still had to get up early.

471
00:59:40,399 --> 00:59:43,169
The Air Force did not allow women to go to missions.

472
00:59:43,369 --> 00:59:47,206
So that we tested roncsderbiken absence of any other activity.

473
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:51,544
You wanted to compete to base, your old Musztángoddal, of course I did not mind.

474
00:59:51,744 --> 00:59:55,448
I knew it was pressed under the Camarommal. But you cheated. And cut off the road.

475
00:59:55,648 --> 00:59:59,219
- Since the slaughter fraud? - Since then, it goes against the rules.

476
00:59:59,419 --> 01:00:03,189
- They did not protect. - Hmm. This did not surprise me.

477
01:00:07,626 --> 01:00:12,573
When I got to the border, Lawson was pretty nervous.

478
01:00:12,773 --> 01:00:16,669
He said somebody lives are in danger.

479
01:00:16,669 --> 01:00:23,943
- He wanted to fly, but you said ... - If someone is in danger, then I'm flying.

480
01:00:24,143 --> 01:00:25,245
Yes. Amen.

481
01:00:25,445 --> 01:00:27,480
You finally caught the muffle.

482
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,315
Both.

483
01:00:31,817 --> 01:00:33,920
Okay, you can always bro ...

484
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:41,092
That is why we fought. Now you think that you come from another planet?

485
01:00:41,861 --> 01:00:43,663
I can not imagine how hard it was for you.

486
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:46,998
All things related to you. And now...

487
01:00:51,633 --> 01:00:55,975
So, that was hard, I lost my best friend.

488
01:00:56,175 --> 01:01:00,345
A mission that is as if it never happened.

489
01:01:01,981 --> 01:01:07,987
I believed you. Because I knew, no matter where you are, or too stubborn to die.

490
01:01:08,187 --> 01:01:14,026
And after that once you set only after six years, super strong blaster hand.

491
01:01:14,226 --> 01:01:17,562
And that city that I call you, I do not know Verse?

492
01:01:17,762 --> 01:01:24,527
- Are you really changed? - I do not know.

493
01:01:30,109 --> 01:01:32,711
Come check them out.

494
01:01:38,684 --> 01:01:40,085
In what we are here for Halloween.

495
01:01:40,285 --> 01:01:43,521
Emilia Eikhardnak I dressed you and Janise Joblinennak.

496
01:01:43,721 --> 01:01:47,060
Oh, and this is still small. You did not come out to your parents well.

497
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:48,928
So we became a family.

498
01:01:49,128 --> 01:01:52,598
It was Christmas. Then I got a little slippers.

499
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:58,603
This summer he won terveztétek ... This earrings mother ...

500
01:01:58,803 --> 01:02:03,541
This is when you were on good terms with Uncle Jason. That is, when you were in Ohio for two years.

501
01:02:03,741 --> 01:02:07,441
It was here on the porch. Oh, wait really.

502
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:12,117
The jacket. Mom will not allow me to wear one since ketchupoztam together.

503
01:02:25,664 --> 01:02:28,434
Only thing left after the accident.

504
01:02:29,034 --> 01:02:30,403
And this thought.

505
01:02:35,306 --> 01:02:38,644
- Do not open it. - It's just my neighbor.

506
01:02:38,844 --> 01:02:41,513
they can change over Bárkivé.

507
01:02:45,817 --> 01:02:48,720
- Kézcsókom. - What does he want?

508
01:02:49,522 --> 01:02:53,260
- I just ... - Hi, Tom. This is my friend Carol.

509
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:59,965
Ah, nice to meet you. Ouch. That was a shocking experience.

510
01:03:00,966 --> 01:03:04,035
Oh, I saw the bird, which is beside the road.

511
01:03:04,235 --> 01:03:07,507
It would not be a problem if the guys átugranánk to quickly megkukkantsuk.

512
01:03:07,707 --> 01:03:11,176
- To megkukkantsátok? - Yes. - A bird?

513
01:03:11,376 --> 01:03:14,246
Which is by the way? Hm.

514
01:03:14,447 --> 01:03:17,450
Very odateszed itself to selling the piece, huh?

515
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:22,053
- Depart. - I'm sorry Tom, now is not suitable.

516
01:03:22,253 --> 01:03:24,155
Then jump over tomorrow. Okay?

517
01:03:24,355 --> 01:03:25,725
- Oh, but ... - Hey You.

518
01:03:27,928 --> 01:03:30,996
You really could be nicer to your neighbors.

519
01:03:31,196 --> 01:03:34,667
If you ask for something if you need to borrow from them again.

520
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:43,709
Only slowly in the body. You do not need to come into a fire and waving a hand.

521
01:03:43,909 --> 01:03:47,213
But do not subvert your girlfriend's house.

522
01:03:47,413 --> 01:03:48,581
Very nice home there.

523
01:03:48,781 --> 01:03:53,620
Oh, my God. What the hell?

524
01:03:55,754 --> 01:03:57,589
We will not hurt the girl.

525
01:03:58,189 --> 01:03:59,992
Just do not kill it.

526
01:04:00,192 --> 01:04:04,396
- The very belerondítana of things. - approx. Five seconds and polluting ...

527
01:04:04,596 --> 01:04:06,999
- ... into the Skrull mocsadék a bullet into his brain.

528
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:11,837
I'm sorry to my boss into my skin. But now I'm standing here, full valómban.

529
01:04:12,037 --> 01:04:14,872
- No hocus-pocus. - And who's out there in the yard?

530
01:04:15,441 --> 01:04:21,847
Well. This is a legitimate question. But that obviously agree that no harm precaution.

531
01:04:22,047 --> 01:04:26,551
In fact, the last time you szétverted my people. Such a thing was not your hand.

532
01:04:26,751 --> 01:04:29,188
- Just talk. - When last we spoke,

533
01:04:29,388 --> 01:04:32,758
- I was hanging upside down. -Maybe, but I did not know who you are.

534
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:36,027
I do not even know that different, than the others.

535
01:04:36,695 --> 01:04:42,300
I have a voice Pegazusos. Your song voice. A crashed machine.

536
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:47,707
Six years ago. He says recordings that allegedly call a black box.

537
01:04:48,007 --> 01:04:52,711
They were told it was destroyed in the accident. How did you get it?

538
01:04:52,912 --> 01:04:56,881
Still do not understand? Cutie still know a few tricks, which you can get,

539
01:04:57,081 --> 01:04:58,984
In places where you should not.

540
01:04:59,184 --> 01:05:03,054
If you ever call Aranyoskámnak, get drunk in a place where you should not.

541
01:05:05,157 --> 01:05:07,660
Now you should find that any part of the body?

542
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:08,618
The ass.

543
01:05:08,818 --> 01:05:13,666
Okay clear, everyone is a little tense. But just listen to please.

544
01:05:13,866 --> 01:05:17,301
To decode some coordinates. If you sit down and listen?

545
01:05:17,501 --> 01:05:20,472
I assure you that you will not regret.

546
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,065
Call your buddy and I listen.

547
01:05:26,265 --> 01:05:27,480
Okay.

548
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,081
Where they picked?

549
01:05:29,281 --> 01:05:31,283
Get out of here. How did this come in?

550
01:05:31,483 --> 01:05:36,855
The cat? You say that's not what you fear.

551
01:05:36,421 --> 01:05:40,325
This is not kittens. But a Felker.

552
01:05:40,525 --> 01:05:42,594
Ha ha. A Flerken.

553
01:05:50,169 --> 01:05:53,639
- Monica. - Why did not I listen?

554
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:23,735
- What are we waiting? - To open.

555
01:06:27,473 --> 01:06:30,542
Punch in the coordinates. 5229 negative 47th

556
01:06:30,742 --> 01:06:33,945
- 8 768 0 throughout the whole 2 - I.

557
01:06:34,145 --> 01:06:37,015
- Where are we going, Doc? - In my lab.

558
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:41,788
- The lab? What do you mean. - Oh no. The one...

559
01:06:41,988 --> 01:06:44,455
I mean, what is it? I do not see it on the radar.

560
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:46,425
Carol pressure, gas him.

561
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:50,528
- What is that Lawson? What the hell is this? - The bad boys. Let's get into it.

562
01:06:50,728 --> 01:06:52,430
- Switch. - Yes.

563
01:07:00,805 --> 01:07:00,673
- What do they want? - Me. In my plans.

564
01:07:00,873 --> 01:07:02,274
Too bad that I brought with me.

565
01:07:07,745 --> 01:07:09,515
the rocket is coming.

566
01:07:28,334 --> 01:07:29,937
Backwards firing. Hold on.

567
01:07:40,413 --> 01:07:42,314
Catapult. Catapult. Catapult.

568
01:07:46,019 --> 01:07:47,452
Lawson perseverance.

569
01:08:06,039 --> 01:08:08,439
- Carol hear? - Yes, I can hear you.

570
01:08:08,639 --> 01:08:10,741
- We crash. - Carol Are you all right?

571
01:08:10,941 --> 01:08:13,044
- Can you hear? - Yes, I can hear you.

572
01:08:16,347 --> 01:08:23,222
- Doc, the blood ... - Blue, I know.

573
01:08:24,122 --> 01:08:26,125
But what kind of hair?

574
01:08:26,559 --> 01:08:29,428
Help to get out.

575
01:08:29,628 --> 01:08:35,334
I have to destroy before they get here.

576
01:08:35,469 --> 01:08:39,438
- Lawson. - Remember what I said about our work?

577
01:08:39,638 --> 01:08:42,942
- What is the purpose? -Lezárni wars?

578
01:08:43,142 --> 01:08:44,142
Again.

579
01:08:44,342 --> 01:08:46,844
But more wars than you think.

580
01:08:47,946 --> 01:08:52,183
Bass. Lawson is not my real name.

581
01:08:52,383 --> 01:08:55,320
In fact, they call MARVEL

582
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,589
And I was not born on earth, but the fish-n.

583
01:08:58,789 --> 01:09:03,027
I would say delirious. But, now she fired off a spaceship.

584
01:09:03,227 --> 01:09:05,396
And blue, blue blood.

585
01:09:05,596 --> 01:09:09,601
Listen for a long time fought a shameful war.

586
01:09:09,801 --> 01:09:12,638
Get out, for you at least do not have remorse.

587
01:09:12,838 --> 01:09:15,606
Just do not forget the coordinates.

588
01:09:15,806 --> 01:09:19,078
- Without need to save them. - Who? How?

589
01:09:19,278 --> 01:09:23,916
For now, this should blow just before you find.

590
01:09:42,335 --> 01:09:45,436
Relax do not want to hurt you.

591
01:09:45,636 --> 01:09:50,141
No? But I was beginning to believe the former lövöldözésből.

592
01:09:51,343 --> 01:09:54,512
The nuclear energy? Where is?

593
01:09:54,712 --> 01:09:57,166
rescue teams are coming.

594
01:09:57,366 --> 01:09:59,985
Two minutes later they surround you.

595
01:10:00,185 --> 01:10:02,653
In this case, there is no reason to drag this conversation.

596
01:10:02,853 --> 01:10:03,853
Do not wait.

597
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:11,629
The nuclear energy?

598
01:10:16,868 --> 01:10:17,301
Born.

599
01:11:00,713 --> 01:11:02,948
Commander. Even moving.

600
01:11:03,148 --> 01:11:05,784
- Permission to shoot. - Leave it do not shoot.

601
01:11:15,427 --> 01:11:18,430
There was nothing left. It destroyed the core.

602
01:11:29,408 --> 01:11:31,142
Comprising infiltrating the force.

603
01:11:32,678 --> 01:11:34,813
transferred to us.

604
01:11:55,667 --> 01:11:57,134
Yon-Rogg lied.

605
01:11:59,438 --> 01:12:01,540
All I knew was a lie.

606
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:07,045
- Now, you understand now. - What? What do you understand now?

607
01:12:07,245 --> 01:12:10,282
Yon-Rogg Marvel killed. He killed.

608
01:12:10,482 --> 01:12:14,152
MARVEL because he realized that waging unjust wars.

609
01:12:14,352 --> 01:12:15,352
- And it is on the wrong side. - No. Ye are all terrorists.

610
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:23,527
murder innocent. I saw the ruins of Torf.

611
01:12:23,727 --> 01:12:26,697
The ruins of Torf devastation caused by the accusers.

612
01:12:26,897 --> 01:12:30,868
The people lived as refugees in Torf.

613
01:12:31,068 --> 01:12:36,707
Homeless, we rebelled against the Kree. And they decided to ruin our planet.

614
01:12:36,907 --> 01:12:42,313
And the handful of survivors, felkoncolják soon.

615
01:12:42,513 --> 01:12:46,551
Unless you finish what you started MARVEL.

616
01:12:48,185 --> 01:12:54,059
The seed, he came up with the speed of light would be thrown us a new homeland by boat.

617
01:12:54,926 --> 01:12:57,596
Where the Kreeka not reach the hands.

618
01:12:57,963 --> 01:13:02,233
Lawson has always said that our work does not help to fight wars.

619
01:13:02,433 --> 01:13:03,701
It's closed.

620
01:13:04,002 --> 01:13:09,240
He wanted to help us. Find the lab.

621
01:13:10,008 --> 01:13:13,578
- But I already blew up. - Just blew up a gear.

622
01:13:13,778 --> 01:13:19,150
the fuel itself is in a remote location. If you help decode the coordinates.

623
01:13:20,576 --> 01:13:21,986
Finding.

624
01:13:24,289 --> 01:13:31,162
- captured him destroy us. - Only yearn for home.

625
01:13:35,201 --> 01:13:42,541
You have to. There was everything to us, because of the Kree. You still do not understand?

626
01:13:42,741 --> 01:13:45,011
You're not one of them.

627
01:13:46,745 --> 01:13:52,083
You do not know me. You have no idea who I am.

628
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:56,388
I myself do not even know who I am.

629
01:13:57,889 --> 01:14:00,125
But Carol Denvers are.

630
01:14:01,661 --> 01:14:06,865
The woman, who is in the photograph, risked his life for a good cause.

631
01:14:08,233 --> 01:14:12,237
My best friend. Who supported a mother.

632
01:14:12,437 --> 01:14:14,539
And as a pilot when no one else.

633
01:14:15,507 --> 01:14:19,744
You're clever. Funny. Baromira and annoying.

634
01:14:20,312 --> 01:14:23,315
Even then, people did not know is stronger than you.

635
01:14:23,515 --> 01:14:26,751
Even when your hand is not struck by the flames.

636
01:14:28,019 --> 01:14:28,787
Do you hear.

637
01:14:30,411 --> 01:14:31,923
Do you hear what I'm saying.

638
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:41,633
- Come here. - Come here.

639
01:14:47,429 --> 01:14:53,645
I know I do not deserve your trust. But there was no other hope.

640
01:14:53,845 --> 01:14:58,883
We have seen that just as the energy emanating from you as MARVEL seeds.

641
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:01,553
It just found out why.

642
01:15:03,288 --> 01:15:07,392
I wish I knew how important this is to me.

643
01:15:08,393 --> 01:15:14,264
I do not want anything from you just to decrypt me MARVEL lab coordinates.

644
01:15:14,464 --> 01:15:17,468
Those coordinates are not. But state vectors.

645
01:15:17,668 --> 01:15:19,704
They give the position of the space.

646
01:15:19,904 --> 01:15:22,473
They have not found on the floor of the lab because it is not here.

647
01:15:22,673 --> 01:15:24,909
We know where we were on the day of the crash.

648
01:15:25,109 --> 01:15:28,847
If you calculate the trajectory we find in space, now.

649
01:15:29,047 --> 01:15:31,182
It's just simple physics.

650
01:15:33,152 --> 01:15:34,785
In space.

651
01:15:36,354 --> 01:15:39,857
- It would have been so hard to figure out? - You are a child of an engineer, right?

652
01:15:40,292 --> 01:15:43,062
Yon-Rogg gets here soon.

653
01:15:43,262 --> 01:15:45,997
We must find the seed still in front.

654
01:15:46,197 --> 01:15:48,100
Hm. Direction in space?

655
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:48,832
Because?

656
01:15:49,032 --> 01:15:53,270
I should just change a few things on your machine. Happy to have you tinkering.

657
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:55,073
Ha, ha. The engineer child.

658
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:07,652
- I could use a copilot. - No. No, I can not.

659
01:16:07,852 --> 01:16:09,054
I can not leave him here.

660
01:16:09,254 --> 01:16:12,390
Mom, Grandma go ahead and take care of me.

661
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:15,125
THE. No way to go, baby. Too dangerous.

662
01:16:15,325 --> 01:16:17,429
Brand new space planes get tested.

663
01:16:17,629 --> 01:16:18,764
Yet you do.

664
01:16:19,765 --> 01:16:23,501
If you are planning to step out of the atmosphere is not one designed for typing.

665
01:16:23,701 --> 01:16:27,906
Meanwhile, a technologically advanced enemy forces could attack at any time.

666
01:16:28,106 --> 01:16:28,907
Am I right?

667
01:16:29,406 --> 01:16:31,069
I'm talking about this. Go with it. Good.

668
01:16:31,242 --> 01:16:32,010
Monica.

669
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:34,179
Legkirályibb world can participate in the mission.

670
01:16:34,379 --> 01:16:38,082
But you'd rather stay here to look me in California came to me.

671
01:16:38,282 --> 01:16:39,282
- My?

672
01:16:39,482 --> 01:16:43,021
No times have not stopped thinking about it, that you show an example of how this daughter.

673
01:16:51,563 --> 01:16:54,531
- What is this conspiracy? - I'm sorry. Inside, I'll tell you.

674
01:16:54,731 --> 01:16:55,734
Thanks for coming.

675
01:17:00,471 --> 01:17:06,044
Great mom lucky. It seems he's got the coolest girl in the world.

676
01:17:06,244 --> 01:17:10,115
- Lieutenant Tangle. - Well, do you remember?

677
01:17:11,549 --> 01:17:15,320
It was mine? No, you do not need.

678
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,822
Be with you until I get back.

679
01:17:18,022 --> 01:17:21,927
But there is one thing that would help me.

680
01:17:22,127 --> 01:17:23,961
I can not run around anymore Kree colors.

681
01:17:24,161 --> 01:17:28,767
And because apparently you are the only taste of the whole band.

682
01:17:29,935 --> 01:17:34,239
- Hmm. - Wow.

683
01:17:37,576 --> 01:17:46,519
No. A, A. Definitely not ...

684
01:17:47,719 --> 01:17:49,888
Well anyway because we are a team.

685
01:18:03,635 --> 01:18:09,674
- What is the structure? - Loose.

686
01:18:30,012 --> 01:18:34,031
- What took you so long? - Anyway, I'm fine thanks.

687
01:18:34,231 --> 01:18:37,369
- VRY46 - Leave the codes.

688
01:18:37,569 --> 01:18:39,837
We know that the system is circumvented.

689
01:18:40,037 --> 01:18:41,806
From me. Ask me off.

690
01:18:42,808 --> 01:18:46,110
Who can see when I talk to the chief of intelligence?

691
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:48,979
I think you see, whom you look up to the most.

692
01:18:49,179 --> 01:18:51,381
But you never betray.

693
01:18:51,581 --> 01:18:54,853
Let's hear what the earliest memories about the fish.

694
01:18:55,053 --> 01:18:58,289
A blood transfusion. Blue blood running through my veins.

695
01:18:58,489 --> 01:19:00,025
Whose?

696
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:12,438
It was in my blood.

697
01:19:12,638 --> 01:19:14,371
The flows in his veins.

698
01:19:20,112 --> 01:19:22,680
- What have you done to him? - You're late.

699
01:19:39,506 --> 01:19:41,131
So you know.

700
01:19:55,547 --> 01:19:59,984
Ronan, Skrull appeared on the C53. Come immediately.

701
01:20:00,184 --> 01:20:02,420
The good of Kreek. Commander.

702
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:04,822
We will cut off the parasites.

703
01:20:05,022 --> 01:20:09,560
Height 500 and climbing.

704
01:20:12,397 --> 01:20:16,100
Listen only. That thing really should not keep on your lap.

705
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:19,269
In our association with you it is pretty weak.

706
01:20:19,469 --> 01:20:23,141
And as long as these morbidly his aversion to cicustól than now.

707
01:20:23,341 --> 01:20:28,579
Until puszilgatom and hugging this little cute strength without stopping.

708
01:20:28,779 --> 01:20:32,650
Can I ask you something? You really can change at any Advances?

709
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:35,752
- Oh, what I see in front of him. - Minannyijuknak go?

710
01:20:35,952 --> 01:20:42,092
Well, theoretically, yes. But you have to practice, not to show off,

711
01:20:42,292 --> 01:20:44,394
But talent can be added.

712
01:20:44,594 --> 01:20:46,931
- Cats also can be? What is that?

713
01:20:47,131 --> 01:20:49,534
- And let's say a filing cabinet? - I do not understand.

714
01:20:49,734 --> 01:20:51,803
Why iratszekrénnyé changing?

715
01:20:52,003 --> 01:20:55,907
Venus Flytrap? I'll give you fifty bucks if Venus is changing flapper become.

716
01:20:56,107 --> 01:20:59,978
I associate fusion radiation gear unit. turn belts.

717
01:21:09,254 --> 01:21:12,157
This is normal? This űrturbulencia?

718
01:21:12,357 --> 01:21:13,791
Very.

719
01:21:47,025 --> 01:21:48,793
Stabilized our position.

720
01:21:49,394 --> 01:21:50,695
Where can I?

721
01:21:53,999 --> 01:21:56,667
Here. It should be ...

722
01:21:57,268 --> 01:22:02,173
Okay. Let's be clear there is nothing in front or behind the large.

723
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:10,114
Deactivating a disguise.

724
01:22:22,094 --> 01:22:25,863
MAR-VELL LABORATORY. Kree empire of SHIP.

725
01:23:13,377 --> 01:23:17,215
- That would be? The core? - MAR-VELL referred to as Tessaract.

726
01:23:23,688 --> 01:23:23,922
Wow.

727
01:23:26,057 --> 01:23:28,392
What did you do with all these childish kacattal?

728
01:23:42,074 --> 01:23:43,274
We are not alone.

729
01:24:06,163 --> 01:24:07,531
Talos.

730
01:24:17,874 --> 01:24:20,145
We're not here to Tessaractért.

731
01:24:42,866 --> 01:24:44,201
Do not be afraid.

732
01:24:49,064 --> 01:24:53,711
we do not what to do. MAR-VELL tied the souls that do not send an alarm.

733
01:24:53,911 --> 01:24:57,849
- Because I find the Kreek. - well you do it.

734
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:12,162
Chill nothing wrong. Do not be afraid of him our friend.

735
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:15,433
I will not hurt you.

736
01:25:15,633 --> 01:25:17,201
He brought me here.

737
01:25:18,536 --> 01:25:20,036
I'm really sorry.

738
01:25:21,872 --> 01:25:26,511
- I did not know. - Carol, it's war.

739
01:25:27,578 --> 01:25:30,715
I can not in my hands stained.

740
01:25:31,682 --> 01:25:33,651
But here we are.

741
01:25:33,851 --> 01:25:36,087
You found my family.

742
01:25:40,392 --> 01:25:45,463
This is just the beginning. Thousands of our brothers live in small groups.

743
01:25:46,029 --> 01:25:48,832
Across the entire universe.

744
01:26:06,784 --> 01:26:10,823
If I were the same nyüstölnem pinball six years, it also has a few records.

745
01:26:14,058 --> 01:26:17,260
- cimborálsz the enemy? - THE. the.

746
01:26:29,272 --> 01:26:32,310
Yet what did you do to egyenruháddal? - they stirred it in the brain.

747
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:35,246
- Just as we thought. - The supreme intelligence lays location.

748
01:26:35,446 --> 01:26:38,065
You see, that they were not soldiers. Leave them alone.

749
01:26:38,265 --> 01:26:40,407
- ye me. - And the core?

750
01:26:40,607 --> 01:26:46,191
- you lied to me. - I reached to get the best out of yourself.

751
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:52,897
What you got, now we return.

752
01:27:07,745 --> 01:27:09,547
Come here to me.

753
01:27:53,124 --> 01:27:58,695
There you are. He spent time on the C53 called up the memories.

754
01:27:58,895 --> 01:28:03,199
This cool jacket killer. Seriously.

755
01:28:03,790 --> 01:28:08,005
Aha. Dizsizzünk. It's cool.

756
01:28:08,205 --> 01:28:11,641
- It's over now. - you should not even think.

757
01:28:11,841 --> 01:28:15,912
If you bothering them. Kicsinállak I swear to you.

758
01:28:16,112 --> 01:28:19,482
Exactly what? Our strength comes from.

759
01:28:19,682 --> 01:28:22,353
Does not come from you my abilities. But the explosion.

760
01:28:22,553 --> 01:28:25,122
Cancel were strong enough to dominate them alone.

761
01:28:35,765 --> 01:28:39,335
Species: Felkren. Risk: Major.

762
01:28:44,876 --> 01:28:47,345
Of a cat. Luther did not Hannibal.

763
01:28:47,545 --> 01:28:53,951
Species: Human. Risk: Negligible.

764
01:28:55,785 --> 01:28:57,054
It sure as hell went wrong.

765
01:28:57,254 --> 01:28:59,489
Vídd a Flerkent a Helionra.

766
01:28:59,689 --> 01:29:01,926
The rest Shoot it out into space.

767
01:29:04,962 --> 01:29:06,531
Well done Poetry.

768
01:29:06,731 --> 01:29:13,137
Thanks to you, they are insidious shape-shifters never threaten our borders.

769
01:29:13,337 --> 01:29:17,941
I believed your lies. But the Skrull just looking for a home.

770
01:29:18,141 --> 01:29:21,878
You want to wipe them out because they did not surrender arms.

771
01:29:22,078 --> 01:29:24,215
- And I will not. - We found you.

772
01:29:24,415 --> 01:29:27,617
- We receptive ourselves in. - kidnapped.

773
01:29:27,817 --> 01:29:31,155
From home. In my family, from my friends.

774
01:29:38,896 --> 01:29:41,599
Or cute, so you try.

775
01:29:43,234 --> 01:29:45,436
Go into it.

776
01:29:45,636 --> 01:29:52,176
Without us, or weak.

777
01:29:52,876 --> 01:29:53,944
you're going too fast.

778
01:29:58,850 --> 01:30:02,620
Helpless. Too hot blooded. And still feel overwhelmed.

779
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:04,944
We saved.

780
01:30:13,963 --> 01:30:16,934
Without us, only human.

781
01:30:18,469 --> 01:30:22,172
As you say. I'm a man.

782
01:30:57,508 --> 01:31:02,013
The fish-n born again. Poem.

783
01:31:06,382 --> 01:31:09,620
My name is Carol.

784
01:31:24,882 --> 01:31:26,471
Try to break out.

785
01:32:10,581 --> 01:32:13,417
Fetter was beaten down as he struggled.

786
01:32:14,885 --> 01:32:16,152
But what happens then?

787
01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:21,192
When I'm finally free.

788
01:33:01,965 --> 01:33:04,034
You know, to shine, right?

789
01:33:04,967 --> 01:33:06,135
I'll explain later.

790
01:33:08,296 --> 01:33:10,574
Hold the Tessaractot. Leave the box here.

791
01:33:11,274 --> 01:33:12,276
- I? - Yes.

792
01:33:12,776 --> 01:33:14,211
I will not touch it.

793
01:33:14,411 --> 01:33:15,846
You get mitts?

794
01:33:21,852 --> 01:33:22,619
Vauu.

795
01:33:28,859 --> 01:33:30,895
Take the Skrullokat the machine.

796
01:33:31,628 --> 01:33:33,831
You're going to be posted.

797
01:33:34,031 --> 01:33:36,467
- What about me? - I gain you some time.

798
01:33:38,634 --> 01:33:40,103
HE. I'll pick you up.

799
01:33:43,473 --> 01:33:45,809
I hope you will not devour me.

800
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:52,049
Billboards.

801
01:33:55,819 --> 01:33:57,356
Arm wrestling in a Tessaractért?

802
01:34:00,191 --> 01:34:04,895
Long ago I could to humor you. Close it down.

803
01:34:39,663 --> 01:34:42,199
- Aj month. - No cicázott.

804
01:35:28,435 --> 01:35:29,979
You knew all along.

805
01:35:31,014 --> 01:35:34,351
- why not say too much? - No. I never could figure.

806
01:35:41,158 --> 01:35:44,465
Now stop.

807
01:36:10,455 --> 01:36:13,657
This is it. Swallow them.

808
01:36:14,659 --> 01:36:16,994
Come on.

809
01:36:18,228 --> 01:36:19,463
Do it.

810
01:36:19,663 --> 01:36:25,168
Bass Goose. Decide who you are.

811
01:36:29,406 --> 01:36:31,140
Take them to the hangar.

812
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:33,711
the authors of all the space.

813
01:36:35,713 --> 01:36:37,313
Chill out there.

814
01:36:38,512 --> 01:36:39,883
As Havana.

815
01:36:40,984 --> 01:36:44,656
- Do you have the stuff? The kitten ate flerken.

816
01:36:58,537 --> 01:37:00,337
Come on. Move.

817
01:37:01,181 --> 01:37:02,772
Action starts.

818
01:37:07,310 --> 01:37:08,379
Shut your eyes.

819
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:19,490
Forward. Briskly. Running.

820
01:37:43,313 --> 01:37:47,351
- was a clever trick. - I could have sworn that I put into it.

821
01:38:43,539 --> 01:38:47,010
- Minn-Ervan go pick them off. - Now.

822
01:38:51,414 --> 01:38:56,018
- All right, buddy? - Never better.

823
01:39:00,191 --> 01:39:02,892
Offensive come. You'll receive.

824
01:40:41,226 --> 01:40:42,558
This is it.

825
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:05,615
What was that?

826
01:41:28,504 --> 01:41:31,474
They go ballistic missiles.

827
01:42:23,127 --> 01:42:27,831
This is impossible. The C53 is not at an advanced protection system.

828
01:42:28,031 --> 01:42:30,333
Which stand in the way rakétáinknak.

829
01:42:31,635 --> 01:42:33,903
This is not a defense system Ronan.

830
01:43:50,313 --> 01:42:40,304
Lőjétek it.

831
01:43:50,313 --> 01:43:52,215
Head for the jump point.

832
01:43:52,516 --> 01:43:54,718
But then we come back for the gun.

833
01:43:56,477 --> 01:44:01,325
- The Mager? - No, the woman.

834
01:44:48,872 --> 01:44:51,541
I'm so proud of you.

835
01:44:51,741 --> 01:44:56,179
You really evolved a good deal since I found you.

836
01:44:56,580 --> 01:45:01,918
Can you keep your emotions in check when you coping?

837
01:45:02,118 --> 01:45:04,420
As usual, the pimp or no power over?

838
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:11,928
I often told. You'll be able to knock me to the fighters when their fortress.

839
01:45:12,128 --> 01:45:15,464
The moment has come. Came. That moment, Vers.

840
01:45:15,664 --> 01:45:20,936
Let the fireworks and show that you can win off.

841
01:45:35,185 --> 01:45:37,687
I do not have to prove anything to you.

842
01:45:52,726 --> 01:45:55,071
New destination, head to the Hala.

843
01:45:55,271 --> 01:45:57,339
I can not go back empty-handed.

844
01:45:57,539 --> 01:46:01,344
You do not go empty-handed. I'll send you a message.

845
01:46:01,544 --> 01:46:04,647
It said the intelligence chief to an end.

846
01:46:04,847 --> 01:46:08,250
The war is a lie. Everything.

847
01:46:09,586 --> 01:46:11,253
You can not do that.

848
01:46:29,572 --> 01:46:34,309
It was warm enough, ah. It does kisses, three. hahaha.

849
01:46:35,812 --> 01:46:36,679
Pocidban there are the bad guys? Ouch.

850
01:46:36,879 --> 01:46:38,682
- Oh snap.

851
01:46:38,882 --> 01:46:39,849
- Well? - Yes.

852
01:46:40,049 --> 01:46:41,784
Just a scratch.

853
01:46:41,984 --> 01:46:42,984
No.

854
01:46:50,795 --> 01:46:51,462
- I wanted before.

855
01:46:51,662 --> 01:46:55,631
It is unbelievable that got into such a harsh air combat and I missed it.

856
01:46:55,831 --> 01:46:57,300
I think it was just in time.

857
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:58,902
Snazzy flying machine.

858
01:46:59,102 --> 01:47:02,070
The SHIELD you still could use such an excellent pilot.

859
01:47:02,270 --> 01:47:06,643
I'll think about it. Just do not tell me about all the cool flying.

860
01:47:07,043 --> 01:47:10,146
- How are your eyes? -Percről more minutes.

861
01:47:10,713 --> 01:47:14,716
So clear. You were Solar, and SHIELD agent too?

862
01:47:14,916 --> 01:47:18,154
Kelor. With his identity is Talos touched down.

863
01:47:18,354 --> 01:47:21,423
I borrowed only for a while. I am not a thief.

864
01:47:21,623 --> 01:47:24,694
- we called robbery. - You, or anyone you are now?

865
01:47:24,894 --> 01:47:26,829
Here you can stay as long pull himself together.

866
01:47:27,029 --> 01:47:29,031
But the new figures should take.

867
01:47:29,231 --> 01:47:32,367
- I could be your boss again. - Oh, let's not.

868
01:47:32,567 --> 01:47:34,972
Come on, I loved the beautiful blue eyes.

869
01:47:35,172 --> 01:47:39,843
What? There's so beautiful eyes. Never change your eyes.

870
01:47:43,245 --> 01:47:46,950
I'll help you find a home. MAR-VELL finish the work.

871
01:47:49,352 --> 01:47:52,187
Here we could stay with us. No, Mom?

872
01:47:53,156 --> 01:47:55,123
Would not be safe, baby.

873
01:47:55,323 --> 01:47:57,160
Carol nénédnek right.

874
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:59,295
My home need them.

875
01:47:59,495 --> 01:48:01,497
You see hip hop right back.

876
01:48:01,697 --> 01:48:05,401
Or let's say we meet halfway in space.

877
01:48:05,601 --> 01:48:07,904
Well, only if you shine just like Aunt Carol.

878
01:48:08,104 --> 01:48:10,736
I might build a spaceship. You do not know.

879
01:48:10,936 --> 01:48:12,008
No. You do not know.

880
01:48:21,418 --> 01:48:24,854
Keep the Tessaractot the ground. Plug in.

881
01:48:25,021 --> 01:48:27,291
Do you think MAR-VELL would want to do this?

882
01:48:28,190 --> 01:48:30,493
- MAR-VELL. - I said that.

883
01:48:30,693 --> 01:48:33,363
Two words. MAR-VELL.

884
01:48:33,563 --> 01:48:37,501
MAR-VELL. slightly better than the band Marverets.

885
01:48:51,713 --> 01:48:54,417
- I do not loom anything? - Fojttassa only if I remember.

886
01:49:10,066 --> 01:49:11,634
Felturbózottam bit.

887
01:49:11,834 --> 01:49:14,805
The Galaxy range is a lower voice.

888
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:19,342
What? Afraid that I'm going to bother you?

889
01:49:19,542 --> 01:49:22,112
It is important to use only in an emergency, right?

890
01:49:30,052 --> 01:49:35,191
Well, once more return to this galaxy, say hello to your buddy.

891
01:49:51,475 --> 01:49:53,109
He came out of ketchup.

892
01:49:58,948 --> 01:50:00,215
Thank you, Lieutenant Gubbanc.

893
01:50:10,492 --> 01:50:12,273
But not easy for me to say goodbye.

894
01:50:26,909 --> 01:50:27,043
Go ahead.

895
01:51:27,069 --> 01:51:29,806
Protect Initiative of the first chapter.

896
01:51:34,477 --> 01:51:37,280
Glad to have you back. It was you.

897
01:51:42,285 --> 01:51:47,890
So it's true? The Kreek fired because his eyes did not give them the Tessaractot?

898
01:51:49,137 --> 01:51:52,728
Well, I will neither confirm nor deny the information is not this.

899
01:51:53,095 --> 01:51:53,928
Clear.

900
01:51:55,731 --> 01:51:58,234
I regret to report that it is not the Tessaract.

901
01:51:58,434 --> 01:52:00,303
Sooner or later, it will be safe.

902
01:52:02,094 --> 01:52:05,207
- let you know if you got it. - And then?

903
01:52:05,407 --> 01:52:10,914
- Sir? -I do not know what dangers peek at us.

904
01:52:11,114 --> 01:52:14,817
In addition, all of a sudden lost another one-man job security for strength.

905
01:52:15,017 --> 01:52:16,820
on the other side of the universe.

906
01:52:19,622 --> 01:52:24,694
SHIELD alone will be enough. More is needed.

907
01:52:24,894 --> 01:52:28,196
- More weapons? - more heroes.

908
01:52:28,396 --> 01:52:32,301
- We can find things like a woman? - we found him, too, are not searched.

909
01:52:34,204 --> 01:52:37,806
Rest. It is important to take a decision.

910
01:52:49,684 --> 01:52:54,924
CAROL KAPITÁNY.
"AVENGER"

911
01:53:01,697 --> 01:53:03,733
Created by Ysty01 (from zsoszo color).
